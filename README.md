# Reddit addon for KODI 
Reddit is a social news and entertainment website. It is organized into areas of interest called "subreddits" where users share, vote and talk about content they find funny, interesting and/or relevant to the subreddit at hand.

## Kodi addon for reddit.com
This is a video addon for viewing reddit content on Kodi. See also my program addon version, [__reddit_reader__](https://github.com/gedisony/script.reddit.reader)
